    Shiny is one of the best ways to build interactive documents, dashboards, and data science applications. But advancing your skills with Shiny does not come without challenges.
Shiny developers often have a stronger background in applied statistics than in areas useful for optimizing an application, like programming, web development, and user-interface design. Though there are many packages and tools that make developing advanced Shiny apps easier, new developers may not know these tools exist or how to find them.

A vulnerability has been identified for customers using RStudio Connect’s built-in password authentication. Due to the risks involved, password authentication will now require the configuration setting Server.Address for operations that will send emails. If this setting is not configured an error will occur for these operations. More detailed information about the vulnerability will be released in a future post.

It’s better for everyone if the tools used for research and science are free and open. Reproducibility, widespread sharing of knowledge and techniques, and the leveling of the playing field by eliminating cost barriers are but a few of the shared benefits of free software in science.

    We’ve just a made a change to the syntax for embedding MathJax equations in R Markdown documents. The change was made to eliminate some parsing ambiguities and to support future extensibility to additional formats.
The revised syntax adds a “latex” qualifier to the $ or $$ equation begin delimiter. It looks like this:
This change was the result of a few considerations:
 Some users encountered situations where the $equation$ syntax recognized standard text as an equation.

    There’s been lots of excitement about the new R Markdown feature introduced as part of knitr 0.5 and RStudio 0.96. People see R Markdown as both a simpler way to do reproducible research and as a great way to publish to the web from R. Jeromy Anglim has a nice write up on getting started with R Markdown and Marcus Gesmann describes how to embed Google Visualizations using his googleVis package.

    RStudio maintains its own CRAN mirror, http://cran.rstudio.com. The server itself is a virtual machine run by Amazon’s EC2 service, and it syncs with the main CRAN mirror in Austria once per day. When you contact http://cran.rstudio.com, however, you’re probably not talking to our CRAN mirror directly. That’s because we use Amazon CloudFront, a content delivery network, which automatically distributes the content to locations all over the world. When you try to download a package from the Rstudio cloud mirror, it’ll be retrieved from a local CloudFront cache instead of the CRAN mirror itself.

    We’re very pleased to announce the release of devtools 1.2. This version continues to make working with packages easier by increasing installation speed (skipping the build step unless local = FALSE), enhancing vignette handling (to support the non-Sweave vignettes available in R 3.0.0), and providing better default compiler flags for C and C++ code.
Also new in this release is the sha argument to source_url and source_gist. If provided, this checks that the file you download is what your expected, and is an important safety feature when running scripts over the web.

    Shiny version 0.4.0 is now available on CRAN. The most visible change is that the API has been slightly simplified. Your existing code will continue to work, although Shiny will print messages about how to migrate your code. Migration should be straightforward, as described below. It will take a bit of work to switch to the new API, but we think it’s worth it in the long run, because the new interface is somewhat simpler, and because it offers a better mapping between function names and reactive programming concepts.

    Version 0.3.0 of Shiny is now available on CRAN. This version of Shiny has several new features and bug fixes. Some of the changes are under the hood: for example, Shiny now uses a more efficient algorithm for scheduling the execution of reactive functions. There are also some user-facing changes: for example, the new runGitHub() function lets you download and run applications directly from a GitHub repository.
We’ve updated the tutorial page with documentation about these and other features.

We’ve given devtools the 1.0 marker because it now works with the vast majority of packages in the wild, with this version adding support for S4 and Rcpp. Devtools also has completely revamped code for finding Rtools on windows, including much better error messages if something is wrong with your setup. In celebration of reaching 1.0, devtools now has it’s own webpage, which provides a bit more information about why you might want to use it.

    Shiny makes it easy to develop interactive web applications that run on your own machine. But by itself, it isn’t designed to make your applications available to all comers over the internet (or intranet). You can’t run more than one Shiny application on the same port, and if your R process crashes or exits for any reason, your service becomes unavailable.
Our solution is Shiny Server, the application server for Shiny.

Shiny 0.2.3 on CRAN Starting with Shiny 0.2.3, you can install the latest stable version of Shiny directly from CRAN. Since the initial release, we’ve added some interesting features to Shiny, most notably the ability to offer on-the-fly file downloads.

First though more about some exciting new features in Rcpp 0.10.1. This release includes Rcpp attributes, which are simple annotations that you add to C++ source files to streamline calling C++ from R. This makes it possible to write C++ functions and simply source them into R just as you’d source an R script.

Now you can author many types of documents, and build a wide range of applications based on R Markdown. As an effort to unite and improve the documentation of the R Markdown base package (rmarkdown) and several other extensions (such as bookdown, blogdown, pkgdown, flexdashboard, tufte, xaringan, rticles, and learnr) in one place, we authored a book titled “R Markdown: The Definitive Guide”, which is to be published by Chapman & Hall/CRC in about two weeks.

    This is a significant release for Shiny, with a major new feature that was nearly a year in the making: support for asynchronous operations!
Without this capability, when Shiny performs long-running calculations or tasks on behalf of one user, it stalls progress for all other Shiny users that are connected to the same process. Therefore, Shiny apps that feature long-running calculations or tasks have generally been deployed using many R processes, each serving a small number of users; this works, but is not the most efficient approach.

    We’re excited to introduce to you our new website for Shiny: shiny.rstudio.com!

We’ve included articles on many Shiny-related topics, dozens of example applications, and an all-new tutorial for getting started.
Whether you’re a beginner or expert at Shiny, we hope that having these resources available in one place will help you find the information you need.
We’d also like to announce Shiny 0.9, now available on CRAN. This release includes many bug fixes and new features, including:

    We’re very pleased to announce the release of httr 0.3. httr makes it easy to work with modern web apis so that you can work with web data almost as easily as local data. For example, this code shows how might find the most recently asked question about R on stackoverflow:
# install.packages(""httr"") library(httr) # Find the most recent R questions on stackoverflow r <- GET( ""http://api.stackexchange.com"", path = ""questions"", query = list( site = ""stackoverflow.

    We’re pleased to announce a new minor version of dplyr. This fixes a number of bugs that crashed R, and considerably improves the functionality of select(). You can now use named arguments to rename existing variables, and use new functions starts_with(), ends_with(), contains(), matches() and num_range() to select variables based on their names. Finally, select() now makes a shallow copy, substantially reducing its memory impact. I’ve also added the summarize() alias for people from countries who don’t spell correctly ;)

    We’re pleased to announce a new major version of testthat. Version 0.8 comes with a new recommended structure for storing your tests. To better meet CRAN recommended practices, we now recommend that tests live in tests/testthat, instead of inst/tests. This makes it possible for users to choose whether or not to install tests. With this new structure, you’ll need to use test_check() instead of test_packages() in the test file (usually tests/testthat.

    The pool package makes it easier for Shiny developers to connect to databases. Up until now, there wasn’t a clearly good way to do this. As a Shiny app author, if you connect to a database globally (outside of the server function), your connection won’t be robust because all sessions would share that connection (which could leave most users hanging when one of them is using it, or even all of them if the connection breaks).

This release is a major update that provides enhanced error handling and considerably safer default behaviour. Roxygen2 now adds a comment to all generated files so that you know they shouldn’t be edited by hand. This also ensures that roxygen2 will never overwrite a file that it did not create, and can automatically remove files that are no longer needed.

    tidyr is new package that makes it easy to “tidy” your data. Tidy data is data that’s easy to work with: it’s easy to munge (with dplyr), visualise (with ggplot2 or ggvis) and model (with R’s hundreds of modelling packages). The two most important properties of tidy data are:
 Each column is a variable.
 Each row is an observation.
  Arranging your data in this way makes it easier to work with because you have a consistent way of referring to variables (as column names) and observations (as row indices).

    Our first public release of ggvis, version 0.3, is now available on CRAN. What is ggvis? It’s a new package for data visualization. Like ggplot2, it is built on concepts from the grammar of graphics, but it also adds interactivity, a new data pipeline, and it renders in a web browser. Our goal is to make an interface that’s flexible, so that you can compose new kinds of visualizations, yet simple, so that it’s accessible to all R users.

Interactive documents In this release, the biggest changes were under the hood to support the creation of interactive documents. If you haven’t had a chance to check out interactive documents, we really encourage you to do so—it may be the easiest way to learn Shiny.
New layout functions Three new functions—flowLayout(), splitLayout(), and inputPanel()—were added for putting UI elements side by side.

    Some of the most innovative Shiny apps share data across user sessions. Some apps share the results of one session to use in future sessions, others track user characteristics over time and make them available as part of the app.
This level of sophistication creates tricky design choices when you host your app on a server. A nimble server will open new instances of your app to speed up performance, or relaunch your app on a bigger server when it becomes popular.

I’d never suspected that it would have such an impact on the way quite a few people think and write R (including my own), or that pies would be baked (see here) and t-shirts printed (e.g. here) in honor of the successful three-char-long and slightly overweight operator.

    We’re busy at work on the next version of RStudio (v0.99) and this week will be blogging about some of the noteworthy new features. If you want to try out any of the new features now you can do so by downloading the RStudio Preview Release.
The first feature to highlight is a fully revamped implementation of code completion for R. We’ve always supported a limited form of completion however (a) it only worked on objects in the global environment; and (b) it only worked when expressly requested via the tab key.

    RStudio’s code editor includes a set of lightweight Vim key bindings. You can turn these on in Tools | Global Options | Code | Editing:
For those not familiar, Vim is a popular text editor built to enable efficient text editing. It can take some practice and dedication to master Vim style editing but those who have done so typically swear by it. RStudio’s “vim mode” enables the use of many of the most common keyboard operations from Vim right inside RStudio.

    Shiny Server 1.5.1.834 and Shiny Server Pro 1.5.1.760 are now available.
The Shiny Server 1.5.x release family upgrades our underlying Node.js engine from 0.10.47 to 6.9.1. The impetus for this change was not stability or performance, but because the 0.10.x release family has reached the end of its life.
We highly recommend that you test on a staging server before upgrading production Shiny Server 1.4.x machines to 1.5. You should always do this for any production-critical software, but it’s particularly important for this release, due to the magnitude of changes to Node.

    Action buttons can be tricky to use in Shiny because they work differently than other widgets. Widgets like sliders and select boxes maintain a value that is easy to use in your code. But the value of an action button is arbitrary. What should you do with it? Did you know that you should almost always call the value of an action button from observeEvent() or eventReactive()?

    This is a guest post by Vincent Warmerdam of koaning.io.
SparkR preview in Rstudio Apache Spark is the hip new technology on the block. It allows you to write scripts in a functional style and the technology behind it will allow you to run iterative tasks very quickly on a cluster of machines. It’s benchmarked to be quicker than hadoop for most machine learning use cases (by a factor between 10-100) and soon Spark will also have support for the R language.

Recently there have been a number of changes that make it easier to use HTTPS for installing R, RStudio, and packages from CRAN:

    Devtools 1.9.1 is now available on CRAN. Devtools makes package building so easy a package can become your default way to organise code, data, and documentation. You can learn more about developing packages in R packages, my book about package development that’s freely available online..
Get the latest version of devtools with:
install.packages(""devtools"")  There are three major improvements that I contributed:
 check() is now much closer to what CRAN does - it passes on --as-cran to R CMD check, using an env var to turn off the incoming CRAN checks.

Tidy data has variables in columns and observations in rows, and is described in more detail in the tidy data vignette. Install tidyr with:

 mutate() no longer randomly crashes! (Sorry it took us so long to fix this - I know it’s been causing a lot of pain.)
 dplyr now has much better support for non-ASCII column names. It’s probably not perfect, but should be a lot better than previous versions.

    I’m pleased to announce tibble, a new package for manipulating and printing data frames in R. Tibbles are a modern reimagining of the data.frame, keeping what time has proven to be effective, and throwing out what is not. The name comes from dplyr: originally you created these objects with tbl_df(), which was most easily pronounced as “tibble diff”.
Install tibble with:
install.packages(""tibble"")  This package extracts out the tbl_df class associated functions from dplyr.

 When mapping an aesthetic to a constant the default guide title is the name of the aesthetic (i.e. “colour”), not the value (i.e. “loess”). This is a really handy technique for labelling individual layers:  ggplot(mpg, aes(displ, 1 / hwy)) + geom_point() + geom_smooth(method = lm, aes(colour = ""lm""), se = FALSE) + geom_smooth(aes(colour = ""loess""), se = FALSE)   stat_bin() (which powers geom_histogram() and geom_freqpoly()), has been overhauled to use the same algorithm as ggvis.

The following function computes Fibonacci numbers and illustrates the usefulness of memoization. Because the function definition is recursive, the intermediate results can be looked up rather than recalculated at each level of recursion, which reduces the runtime drastically.

    (Post by Dirk Eddelbuettel and JJ Allaire)
A common theme over the last few decades was that we could afford to simply sit back and let computer (hardware) engineers take care of increases in computing speed thanks to Moore’s law. That same line of thought now frequently points out that we are getting closer and closer to the physical limits of what Moore’s law can do for us.
So the new best hope is (and has been) parallel processing.

I’m still working out exactly what purrr should do, and how it compares to existing functions in base R, dplyr, and tidyr. One main insight that has affected much of the current version is that functions designed for programming should be type-stable.

On the scale of ggplot2 releases, this one is huge with over one hundred fixes and improvements. This might break some of your existing code (although I’ve tried to minimise breakage as much as possible), but I hope the new features make up for any short term hassle.

Today, most browsers have good support for SVG and it is a great way of displaying vector graphics on the web.
